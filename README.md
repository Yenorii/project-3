## Info:<br>
Our project revolves around analyzing accident data to gain insights into specific regional patterns. The primary focus is on dividing the accident data by different regions and conducting in-depth analysis within each area.<br>
### Regions:<br>
- South (MD, DE, DC, WV, VA, KY, TN, NC, SC, GA, FL, AL, MS, LA, AR, OK, TX)
- West (MT, ID, WA, OR, CA, NV, NM, AZ, UT, CO, WY, AK, HI)
- Northeast (PA, NJ, NY, NH, VT, RI, MA, ME, CT)
- Midwest (OH, IN, IL, MI, WI, MN, ND, SD, NE, IA, MO, KS)

## Instructions:<br>
To access the project, please visit https://yenorii.github.io/project-3/.<br>
### Using the map:<br>
To best visualize the data, click and drag to navigate the map. Use filters to see data for specific years or regions by selecting the dropdown menus. To view all data, choose "All Years" and "All Regions."<br>

## Ethical Considerations:<br>
Throughout the project, we took proactive steps to ensure that personally identifiable information was not present in the datasets we used for our visualizations. We have also used/provided clear and transparent data sources and references to ensure precision and reliability.<br>
