# UCF Data Sci Bootcamp - Project 3<br>

Our project revolves around analyzing accident data to gain insights into specific regional patterns. The primary focus is on dividing the accident data by different regions and conducting in-depth analysis within each area.

- West (MT, ID, WA, OR, CA, NV, NM, AZ, UT, CO, WY, AK, HI)
- Northeast (PA, NJ, NY, NH, VT, RI, MA, ME, CT)
- Midwest (OH, IN, IL, MI, WI, MN, ND, SD, NE, IA, MO, KS)
